In this project I intend to create a clone airbnb software project that will be similar to the original airbnb. 
Goals I have set is to complete this project before end on the month
Achivement is to learn more about Github and how to create and add repositories

 ## CI/CD Pipeline
 CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, allowing developers to deliver updates quickly and  reliably. Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that new code is automatically tested and merged, while Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)  prepares and pushes code to production with minimal manual effort. Common tools used in CI/CD pipelines include GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and Travis CI for automation; Docker for containerization; and Kubernetes, AWS, or Azure for deployment. These tools help streamline development, reduce bugs, and support faster, safer software releases.
